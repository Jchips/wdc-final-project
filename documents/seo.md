## What is SEO?

SEO is the search engine optimization for a website. It helps attract more viewers to your page, and your page will be more likely to show up in search results if your page has a good SEO score. To improve your SEO score, you can do multiple things like make sure you only use one ```<h1>``` tag on each page (to not confuse the crawlers that go through the page looking for keywords that match a user's search results), using semantic elements, only links other pages with good SEO scores to your website and adding a website description in your meta tags with keywords on what your page is about. You can also use Google Analytics to check what parts of your webpage users are using the most and where their mouse hovers the most. You can use that information to improve your website to get more site viewers.

## SEO proposal

Ideally, I would like to add a good description to the meta tags in all my pages and make buttons on my page so people can share my page on Facebook and Twitter. I would make sure all the pages I'm linking in my website (particularly the ones on the genre page) are credible and seem to have good SEO scores. My site should already have only one ```<h1>``` tag per page, but I would double check that just to make sure. I would also add Google Analytics to my page to see where my viewers are clicking the most. Lastly, I would add more semantic tags in my code and replace the divs with semantic tags when I could.
